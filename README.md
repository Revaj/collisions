# collisions

An example of collision systems by comparing an octree sample against brute force case (even if I'm drawing each object instead of all once time hehe)

Dependencies
*ImGui
*glfw
*glm
*glad unless is Mac


For Mac, use brew to install the dependencies
For Windows, use vcpkg to install them, then open CMakeLists.txt to ensure VS Studio detect it as cmake project and compile/execute the solution
